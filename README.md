# iOS & Webkit Quirks

Webkit-based browsers are... quirky. So is iOS. So are small screens.

This is my list of iOS/Safari/WebKit quirks and potential workarounds for web developers who want to make great mobile-compatible sites that work on all manner of Apple devices.

I created this list because I couldn't find adequate documentation for iOS/Safari/WebKit.

This is not an exhaustive list. I add topics as I learn. Contributions are welcome.
