# iOS & Webkit Quirks

_Webkit-based browsers are... quirky. So is iOS. So are small mobile screens._

- This is my list of iOS/Safari/WebKit quirks and potential workarounds for web developers who want to make great mobile-compatible sites.

- I created this list because I couldn't find adequate documentation for iOS/Safari/WebKit.

- This is not an exhaustive list. I add topics as I learn.

- Contributions are welcome.
